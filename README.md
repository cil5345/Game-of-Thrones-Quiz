# Game of Thrones Quiz


## Intro
Test taking is a constant occurance for students all over the world. It tests the knowlege you learn in class and sees if you can apply what you learned. One of the largest problems with test taking is the huge amount of paper resouces it uses; therefore creating a web based quiz would create better accessabilty and reduce carbon footprints.

## My Quiz
My quiz is based on the hit t.v show/novel "Game of Thrones". It tests trivia within GoT and sees who is actualy a fan of the show. I tried to create my quiz in a more interactive way and tried to make it feel like a video game, rather than a standardized test. This was done with an imersive background,font, and sword cursor. The goal of my quiz is to answer all of the questions before the timer runs out. if the timer runs out before the quiz is finished, the player loses the game and is killed by the white walkers.

## Trouble
This was a very tough project that tested our application of function (), click events, adding elements in j.s, and localStorage. The biggest hurdle for me was connecting the array of objects to the appropiate click function.

## Conclusion 
Despite my frustions, the project was very enjoyable to make. It was very cool to see javascript interacting with HTML and manipulating the page without creating HTML. My current project is not finished, however I liked my concept of a video game rather than a standard quiz. Next time I would add more emersive elements for better user experince. I would have added background music, and audio to the buttons.
